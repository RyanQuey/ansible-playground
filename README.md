Just running some shell scripts on localhost for now, to get a feel for what's possible. To execute plays that go beyond just shell scripts, see [other modules available here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.8/user_guide/modules.html).

Basic gist of this project is found [here](https://gist.github.com/ryantuck/9771990cfdf16b016929).
